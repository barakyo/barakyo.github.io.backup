            <p><p>Well I hope I&#39;m not too late to get my new year resolutions in. I&#39;ve been thinking about this post for a while, but was only finally inspired after my last cup of coffee of 2014. In fact, this day included a lot of lasts. The last swim of the year, the last time I&#39;d visit my brother in 2014, the last time I&#39;d accidentally cut myself in 2014 (I hope), the last..well, I think we all get it. In all seriousness, I don&#39;t usually subscribe to the new year resolution thing, I believe that if you want to change something about your life or self, why wait? But, I also understand the nice things of having a clean slate. In addition, new year resolutions are slightly cliche, but I believe that writing them down will force some accountability. I&#39;d like to review them a year from now and see reflect on how much I&#39;ve kept to them.</p>

<p>Anyways, enough jibber jabber, below are my new year resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read more (and not programming/technical books)</li>
<li>Continue to shoot (photograph) more often and update my blog with some of my favorite pictures!</li>
<li>Graduate and complete my M.S. in Computer Science! My thesis is complete, I need to practice defending it and actually defend!</li>
<li>Try to really help one person a week. I don&#39;t mean holding the door open or letting them in, I mean really help someone.</li>
<li>Talk to/meet new people. Ideally, one new person a day. (I&#39;ll elaborate on this further down)</li>
<li>Continue to swim at least 3x/week! In addition, participate in masters swimming classes as much as possible!</li>
</ul>

<p>To elaborate on the point about talking to and meeting new people, it has to do with me noticing that when I&#39;m somewhere, typically alone, I tend to shy off (into my phone) to not really have to interact with people I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d like to work on breaking that kind of awkward barrier when either waiting around for a cup of coffee or something of that nature.</p>

<p>May everyone have a happy and safe new year! Let&#39;s leave the bad in 2014 and only take the best moments and continue them forward.</p>
