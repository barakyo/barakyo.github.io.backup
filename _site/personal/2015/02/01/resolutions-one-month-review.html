            <p><p>Wow! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s February already! As I stated in my New Year Resolutions post, I wrote down my resolutions so that I could be held accountable for them. Reviewing my resolutions after a year seemed like I would easily lose touch/sight of them. I decided a good idea would be to review my progress month-by-month, so here it goes:</p>

<h4>Read more (and not programming/technical books)</h4>

<p>I believe I&#39;ve been doing a good job of this! My previous post was a review on Ready Player One, which was a fantastic book. I&#39;m still reading technical books (<a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/">Clojure In Actions</a>) As I&#39;ve taking a liking to Clojure, but I&#39;m still making time for other books as well. A close friend of mine recommended reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers: The Story of Success by Martin Gladwell</a>. From what he&#39;s told me, the book sounds incredibly interesting and very motivational. I hope to begin reading this as soon as tomorrow night (02/02/15), so keep an eye out for that review!</p>

<h4>Continue to shoot (photograph) more often and update my blog with some of my favorite pictures!</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve been shooting and posting my favorite pictures to my <a href="http://instagram.com/barakyoo">Instagram</a>, but I haven&#39;t done a good job of posting the pictures to my blog. Be ready for an influx of pictures soon. I&#39;m not sure if I just want to have one post/picture or if I want to setup a sort of gallery. Regardless, release fast and release often, so I&#39;ll have some pictures up this week. I do have a couple of shots that I have in mind and I&#39;d like to be able to get more pictures of activities with my friends, so I&#39;ll hopefully put those in motion this month!</p>

<h4>Graduate and complete my M.S. in Computer Science!</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve enrolled in my final thesis class, which is a step forward towards the path of graduation. I have to proof-read my thesis and practice my defense.</p>

<h4>Try to really help one person a week.</h4>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ve been sticking to this one and it&#39;s probably the thing that bothers me the most. I feel like lately my friends have been helping me out a lot lately, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m recipricating that back to them or towards other people. I don&#39;t exactly have a plan for this one, but hopefully I can put something together soon.</p>

<h4>Talk to/meet new people.</h4>

<p>I also feel that I&#39;ve been dropping the ball on this. This may partially be due to me getting a new phone (and wanting to play around with it), but also just me shying away in general.</p>

<h4>Continue to swim at least 3x/week!</h4>

<p>I think if there is one resolution I&#39;ve excelled at, it&#39;s been this one. Since Christmas, I&#39;ve been swimming about 5x/week and exercising 6x/week. I&#39;ve been attending Masters workouts at least once a week. I feel that my swim game has been improving tremendously. My strokes still need a lot of work, but they&#39;re getting better! Despite my hardwork, I have a plan to improve. Masters workouts are hard for me to make since they&#39;re right in the middle of the day (12-1) and having to get there early, then eat lunch, and go back to work, I lose a big chunk of my day which is why I&#39;ve only been going once a week. I plan to start attending the 6AM-7AM swim workouts, that way I can get my workout out of the way early in the morning and be available for my team/coworkers when it counts!</p>

<p>To summarize, the things I need to work on for the month of February:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read Outliers (and learn Clojure :P)</li>
<li>Post my favorite pictures here</li>
<li>Proofread my thesis and practice my defense</li>
<li>Figure out a plan to help people</li>
<li>Get off my phone when I&#39;m out alone</li>
<li>Start swimming the morning masters workouts</li>
</ul>

<p>Accountability.</p>

<p>One last thing, I realized my &quot;talk to/meet new people&quot; and &quot;try to really help one person a week&quot; goals aren&#39;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART goals</a> which may be why they&#39;re so difficult to identify. Maybe my plan for achieving these resolutions should be to identify them as SMART goals and then execute.</p>
